# K-Means Clustering - Customer Segmentation

This project demonstrates K-Means Clustering using the Mall Customers dataset.

## 📌 Objective
To apply K-Means clustering on a real-world dataset to segment customers based on their behavior.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned dataset
2. Standardized features
3. Used PCA for 2D visualization
4. Applied the Elbow method to determine optimal `k`
5. Performed K-Means clustering
6. Evaluated with Silhouette Score
7. Visualized clusters

## 📁 Files
- `kmeans_clustering.py`: Python script with all steps
- `Mall_Customers.csv`: Dataset (from Kaggle)
- `screenshots/`: Optional screenshots of plots
